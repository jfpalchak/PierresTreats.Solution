# Pierre's Sweet and Savory Treats

Pierre is back! He wants you to create a new application to market his sweet and savory treats. This time, he would like you to build an application with user authentication and a many-to-many relationship. Here are the features he wants in the application:

* The application should have user authentication. 
  * A user should be able to log in and log out. 
  * Only logged in users should have create, update, and delete functionality. 
  * All users should be able to have read functionality.

* There should be a many-to-many relationship between Treats and Flavors. 
  * A treat can have many flavors (such as sweet, savory, spicy, or creamy) and a flavor can have many treats. 
  * For instance, the "sweet" flavor could include chocolate croissants, cheesecake, and so on.
  
* A user should be able to navigate to a splash page that lists all treats and flavors. 
  * Users should be able to click on an individual treat or flavor to see all the treats/flavors that belong to it.
